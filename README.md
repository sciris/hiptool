# hptool

## Installation 

**Step 1:**  Clone the repo

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:sciris/hptool.git
```

**Step 3:** Install `docker-machine` and `docker-compose`

Instructions for `docker-machine` installation can be found here: [Install Docker Machine | Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/). For MacOS you can use homebrew if you have it installed using `brew install docker-machine`

Instruction for docker-compose installation can be found here: [Install Docker Compose | Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#master-builds) . For MacOS you can use homebrew if you have it installed using `brew install docker-compose`

**Step 4:**  Build the images locally

Change to the root of the `hptool` dir:

```
cd hptool
```

To build and run:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.local.yml build
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.local.yml up
```

**Step 5:** follow the instructions on the next section ("Developing the front end") to build the front end.

## Developing the front end

The front end code is inside the `src/` folder.

To install the dependencies required for front end development:

**Step 1:** Install Node.js on your local machine https://nodejs.org/en/download/

**Step 2:** Install the npm dependencies

Go to the the root of the project and then:

```
npm install 
```  

**Step 3:** Build or Watch

Once thatâ€™s done you can run `npm run watch` in order to track changes and rebuild the specific app in `debug/`. 

## Building the frontend for distribution

In order to build production copy of the code you will need to go to the static folder and run `npm run build`. This will create minified copies of the app and place them in `dist/`
