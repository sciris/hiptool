# At the moment (3/8/18) I'm unsure of whether this class should exist at all. 
# A Sciris user will need to create a ProjectSO class in webapp/main.py to 
# wrap whatever Project class or project-relevant data is specific to the app.
# The question is whether this class here can be made into a useful collection 
# of reusable code so that it is worth subclassing.  Another question is 
# whether the more complicated or simpler version of the class below should 
# be developed from.

# more complicated, recent version...
